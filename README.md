# 🪐 Kardashev's Kaleidoscope

### *The Dyson Sphere Planner & Post-Singularity Civilization Simulator*

---

**Kardashev’s Kaleidoscope** is a beautiful, browser-based cosmic simulation engine for building Dyson Spheres—and evolving far beyond them. It combines astrophysics, exotic engineering, quantum computation, and consciousness transfer into a single elegant app.

Built with 💻 **Python + Flask**, 🎨 **custom frontend magic**, and 💡 **a healthy disregard for current engineering limitations**.

---

## 🌌 What Can It Do?

- 🌞 **Choose a strategy**: Dyson Swarm, Ring, Bubble, Quantum, Temporal, Exotic Matter, Cosmic Engineering, Dimensional, Post-Singularity, or Omniversal.
- 🛰 **Simulate** each construction phase: material extraction, thermal regulation, transport systems, colony support, and galactic expansion.
- 🔢 **Visualize orbital segments** using a grid-based heatmap of energy collectors, habitats, traffic routes, and resource zones.
- 🧠 **Unlock advanced metrics** like:
  - Pocket universes created  
  - Black holes harvested  
  - AI evolution levels  
  - Digital realities formed  
  - Consciousness uploads  
  - Dimensional bridges  
- 🧭 **Interactively plan** from a polished front-end interface with glow buttons, twinkling stars, and real-time updates.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.10+, Flask  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no frontend framework, runs buttery smooth)  
- **Simulation Core**: Custom-built DysonSpherePlanner class using `dataclasses`, `enums`, `NumPy`, and raw sci-fi glory  
- **No external APIs. No nonsense. All local.**

## 🚀 Running It Locally

### 1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kindware/KardashevsKaleidoscope-.git
cd KardashevsKaleidoscope-
```

### 2. Install requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Launch the Flask server:

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open your browser and go to:  
📡 `http://localhost:5005`

## 🧠 Strategy Types

| Strategy      | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `swarm`       | Dispersed satellites orbiting independently  
| `ring`        | Niven-style rigid structure  
| `bubble`      | Solar-sail network suspended by radiation pressure  
| `quantum`     | Built with quantum-optimized logistics  
| `temporal`    | Accelerated via time dilation  
| `exotic`      | Uses negative mass and zero-point energy  
| `cosmic`      | Operates on a universal engineering scale  
| `dimensional` | Uses extra dimensions and bridges between realities  
| `singularity` | Post-biological evolution with digital consciousness  
| `omniversal`  | You’re basically a god now. Go wild.  

---

## 💡 Fun To Try

- Run the `singularity` strategy with colony support and watch the metrics explode.
- Try the `cosmic` or `omniversal` builds and see how many universes you can spawn.
- Crank the start year to the distant future just for flavor. (It *still* works.)

---

## 🛠 Want to Expand?

- Add your own strategies to `DysonStrategy` in `dyson_sphere_planner.py`
- Create new UI controls in `index.html` and logic in `script.js`
- Fork it, reskin it, turn it into an educational game or narrative sim
